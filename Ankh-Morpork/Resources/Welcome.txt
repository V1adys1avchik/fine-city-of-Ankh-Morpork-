You are now in fine city of ankh-Morpork!

Ankh-Morpork lies on the River Ankh (the most polluted waterway on the Discworld and reputedly 
solid enough to walk on), where the fertile loam of the Sto Plains meets the Circle Sea. 

This, naturally, puts it in an excellent trading position.

The central city divides more or less into Ankh (the posh part) and Morpork (the humble 
part, which includes the slum area known as "the Shades"), which are separated by the River Ankh.

It can be dangerous to walk the streets. So watch out!
